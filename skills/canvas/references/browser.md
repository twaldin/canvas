# Browser tiles

How omp's browser tool, `canvas browser`, and canvas browser tiles behave, beyond SKILL.md's summary.

omp's `browser` tool (its cmux backend is on automatically inside Canvas) opens a browser tile beside your terminal for each `browser.open({name})`;
`close` deletes it.

- The tool doesn't return the tile id. Find it with `canvas board.history --limit 5` (`agent:<your tile> created … browser <url>`)
  or `canvas board.get` (browser tiles whose `createdBy` is your tile).
- To drive a tile you didn't open (the user's, or one made with `object.create`), open it by id: `browser.open({name: "game", url: "canvas:obj_…"})` drives that tile from its current page instead of opening a new one, and `browser.close` lets go of it (the tile stays). Use a tab name you haven't opened yet.
  To reload any browser tile after an edit: `canvas object.reload --id <tile>` (waits for the load), then `canvas get <tile> --since <cursor>`; never flip `props.url` to a dummy query (it fills the user's Back history).
- The page's viewport is the tile's body: `innerWidth` is the frame width, `innerHeight` the frame height minus 58 (26 pt title bar, 32 pt address bar), at any zoom.
  The tool's `viewport`, `tab.setViewport`, `tab.emulate` and `tab.devices()` don't reach it. To test a width, resize the tile
  (`canvas object.update <id> --json '{"frame":{"w":390,"h":902}}'` for a 390×844 viewport); the user sees the same tile.
  A frame grows right and down from its corner, over whatever is there: grow away from the user's terminals (give `x`/`y` too, e.g. `x` = its right edge − the new width when a terminal sits to its right),
  or resize and then `canvas.layout.place(id=tile, near=<your terminal>, side="left")`. The update result's `overlaps` names what the new frame newly covers; never leave it covering a terminal.
- `tab.evaluate` must return plain values (omp rejects functions that return a promise on this backend); poll with `waitForFunction` for async state.
  On strict-CSP pages (e.g. GitHub) pass functions, not code strings: string code runs through the page's `eval`, which CSP blocks.
- A page you drive or render stays live for 60 s after your last command wherever its tile is (offscreen, window minimized, another Space):
  `visibilityState` is `visible` and timers and `requestAnimationFrame` run. Don't move tiles into the user's view to make them work.
- Before trusting frame or timer numbers, check `canvas get <tile>` → `page.visibility`:
  `visible` (on screen: rAF at the display's rate, 60/120 fps); `driven` (running for you though nobody sees it: rAF irregular and slower, 22–54 fps measured with the window minimized);
  `hidden` (nobody sees it and not driven: no rAF, timers throttled to 1/s and stretching to ~20 s the longer it stays hidden); `released` (no page: 2 min out of view, it is dropped and reloads from `props.url` when seen or driven; the game state is gone).
  Compare numbers only between runs in the same state.
- `canvas render <tile>` loads a page that was never shown and waits up to `--timeoutMs` (8 s).
  `--full` doesn't capture below the fold on browser tiles; make the tile taller instead.
- All browser tiles share one WebKit profile, separate from the user's own browser and signed out: use `gh` or APIs for logged-in state.
- A browser tile's `title` is yours and never overwritten; the page's own title is `props.pageTitle` and doesn't bump `rev`.
- A page that didn't load shows "Can't reach host:port"; a local server's page loads by itself once the server answers, and `view.render` gives the reason.
- The user can click links and buttons in a tile directly. `board.history` credits your terminal with the tiles you open and close
  and with URL changes your commands cause within 10 s (pushState and back included; a `_blank` link opens a tile beside the page, never moving the view);
  the user's clicks are `user`, changes the page makes later on its own `system`.

## `canvas browser` (Claude Code, Codex, scripts)

Without omp's tool, `canvas browser <verb> [<tile>] [--key value] [--json '{…}']` sends one request of the same cmux subset (docs/contracts.md) on `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` and prints the result as JSON.
Errors print `code: message` and exit 1 (`not_found: no element matches #go`, `timeout`, `js_error`). Text params (`--text 1`, `--key 1`) stay strings.

- `open [url]`: a new tile beside your terminal; its id is the result's `surface_id`. `list`: the board's terminals and browser tiles (`id`, `type`, `title`, `url`). `close <tile>` deletes the tile, so close only yours.
- `navigate <tile> --url …`, `back`, `forward`, `reload`, `url.get` (`url`, `title`).
- `snapshot <tile> [--interactive] [--max_depth N]`: an outline with refs (`e1` → `{role, name}`). `--interactive` lists only controls; without it the result adds `page.text` and `page.html`.
- `click`, `dblclick`, `hover`, `focus`, `check`, `uncheck`, `scroll_into_view` with `--selector` (CSS or a ref `@e3`). `fill --selector … --text …` sets a field's value at once (input and change events); `type` sends key events per character, for fields that react to keys.
- `press <tile> --key Enter` (`Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, a character; clipboard and undo shortcuts can't be driven), `scroll <tile> --dy 600`.
- `wait <tile>` with exactly one of `--load_state interactive|complete`, `--url_contains …`, `--selector …`, and `--timeout_ms` (default 30000). After a click that navigates, wait before the next snapshot.
- `eval <tile> --script "…"`: one expression runs in an async function (a promise it returns is awaited, `await` works); statements return their completion value. The page's CSP doesn't apply. Return plain JSON values (`({a: 1})`, not DOM nodes).
- `screenshot <tile> [--out f.png]`: the tile's viewport, one pixel per CSS pixel, written to `--out` (relative to the cwd) or a new file under `$TMPDIR/canvas-renders/`; prints `path`, `width`, `height`. Read the PNG to look at it.

Every driven page stays live 60 s after each command, as with omp's tool. `board.history` credits what your commands cause to the terminal that opened the tile; on a tile someone else opened they show as `system`.
Codex's sandbox blocks the socket: run `canvas browser` escalated, like every canvas command.

## Errors, requests and the dev server

- Tiles record what the page reports from its first line on: console messages, uncaught errors and unhandled rejections, and failed requests (HTTP 400 or more, network errors, images, scripts and styles that didn't load; the page's own document too).
  After an edit and reload, read them instead of assuming a clean page: `canvas get <tile>` → `page.errors`, `page.entries` (`level`, `text`, `source` `url:line:column`, `status`).
  Keep `page.cursor` and pass `canvas get <tile> --since <cursor>` next time to see only what came after (a reload returns all of the new page, `reloaded: true`).
  A page Canvas released keeps its last log in `page.previous` (`releasedAt`, `errors`, `entries`) until the page loads another document after coming back; `page.cursor` stays valid across the release.
  omp's `tab.console()`, `tab.errors()`, `tab.requests()` (fetch/XHR answers plus failed loads as status 0) and `waitForResponse()` see page load too on tiles; `tab.clearConsole()` then reload is not needed.
- The server half is in the terminal running the dev server (`canvas agent.list`: its `program`, e.g. `next dev`, `vite`).
  After edits, read it too: `canvas agent.read --target <that tile> --lines 40` (or its `lastCommand`); compile errors, SSR exceptions and 500s show there, not in the page.
  It is the user's terminal: report what you find, don't restart it unasked.
- `page.vitals`: LCP, FCP, TTFB, DOMContentLoaded and load in ms. Tiles are WebKit (Safari 18 UA): CLS and long tasks are null and listed in `unsupported`; there's no throttling or Lighthouse.
  For those use omp's own headless Chromium browser, not a tile.
- The user sees a small red "N errors" badge in the tile's address bar while the page has errors; a Hyper-click on one in its list mentions it to you (`console` mention: the message, source, stack frames and page).
  A click on a row shows its stack, and a `file:line` served from a file under the board root opens that code; a grey "Reloaded" says the page was released and loaded again.
- Safari's Web Inspector is the user's (page or tile context menu, Inspect Element; ⌥⌘I). Don't open it yourself: its window can land on the user's screen.
