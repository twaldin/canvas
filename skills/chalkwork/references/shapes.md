# Shapes, arrows and groups

The full rules behind SKILL.md's summary.

- `shape`: `{"kind": "rect" | "ellipse" | "text" | "ink", "text": "…", "color": "…", "fill": "none" | "semi" | "solid"}` with a `frame`.
  A rect drawn around tiles *encloses* them.
  - `color`: `black` (the default ink, drawn to contrast with what is under it: dark over a white page, an image or the light canvas, light over the dark canvas or a dark page, on screen and in renders), `grey`, `blue`, `green`, `orange`, `red`, `violet`, or `#rrggbb`. Arrows take `color` too.
  - `fill` (rect/ellipse): `none` (default; the interior passes clicks through), `semi` (a 14% wash of the color, for regions), `solid` (85%).
  - Text sizing: a `text` shape draws its text in 20 pt handwriting from the frame's top-left, wrapping at the frame width;
    one line needs about 30 pt of height (`h ≈ 30 × lines`).
    A rect/ellipse `text` is an 18 pt label centered in the frame, wrapping at `w − 16`.
    Arrow labels are 15 pt, wrapping at 240 pt, centered on the shaft.
- `arrow`: `{"from": {"object": "obj_…"}, "to": {"object": "obj_…", "lines": {"start": 41, "end": 48}}, "relation": "calls", "label": "…", "route": "avoid"}`.
  - Endpoints bind to objects (optionally a line range or a DOM `selector`) or to a `{"point": [x, y]}`. Arrows the user draws bind to the tile or shape their end was released on or near, like `{object}` ends from the API.
  - An end bound to `lines` of a code tile attaches to the tile's left or right edge at the row of `lines.start`
    (the right edge unless the other end lies wholly to the left), so call-site → callee arrows point at the lines.
    It follows the tile's scroll, and a line scrolled out of view pins the end to the top of the code or the bottom of the tile.
    On other tiles `lines` binds the whole tile.
  - `relation` is the machine-readable edge (`calls`, `depends_on`, `hypothesis_about`, …); `label` is what the user reads.
    `relation: "next_step"` makes an order the user can step through: ⌥⌘→ on the selected tile follows its outgoing next_step arrow (⌥⌘← its incoming one) before geometry, centering each stop (fitted readably when the user steps from a zoomed-out overview), and says "Last step" at the end.
    ⌥⌘→ on a group holding the stops, or with nothing selected, starts at the first stop (the one no next_step arrow points to), so group a walkthrough and mark the group "Start here".
    Join a walkthrough's stops with next_step arrows and lay them out however reads best; the order no longer depends on the layout.
    Without a label the arrow shows its relation in a secondary color; `label: ""` shows no caption.
  - `route`: `straight` (default), `orthogonal`, or `avoid` (goes around tiles in the way).
    `avoid` arrows are routed together: arrows sharing a side get their own ports, arrows sharing a gap run in parallel tracks, and each leaves the side of its source that faces downstream (its group's `flow`).
    Arrows between the same two objects are drawn apart automatically, both directions.
    A label sits beside its own arrow where no other line runs, else on its line, else a dashed leader away; in a bundle of parallel lines it is led to its own stub, where its line still runs alone. `layout.check` reports any that couldn't.
    Label chips are outlined in their arrow's color: on a diagram with more than about 6 arrows, color them by lane or flow so each label reads with its line.
- `group`: `{"members": [ids], "title": "…", "color": "blue", "padding": 24, "flow": "down"}` is a titled, tinted region whose frame always wraps its members
  (plus padding and a title band) as they move; use one per lane or cluster instead of a rect plus a text label.
  `flow` (`right`, `down`, `left`, `up`) says which way the diagram inside reads, for `avoid` arrows among its members; without it the board's arrows between groups decide.
