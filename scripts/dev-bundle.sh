# The bundle a development instance runs from: a copy of <app> at <home>/Easl.app that brings
# its instance's environment with it, so however macOS relaunches it (logging back in, the Dock,
# Finder, `open` with no environment) it runs on its own home, never on the user's default one
# beside their live app (docs/testing.md "Development bundles"). Used by scripts/dev.sh and
# scripts/perf-replica.sh; <app> itself (a release bundle, .build/Easl.app, a frozen copy) is
# never changed.
#
#   scripts/dev-bundle.sh [--release-id] <app> <home> [KEY=VALUE…]   prints the copy's path
#
# The copy's Info.plist gets LSEnvironment (EASL_HOME=<home> and the given variables), which
# LaunchServices applies to every launch; CFBundleIdentifier <app's>.dev.<hash of the home>, so
# it shares no user defaults, saved window state, WebKit default store or TCC identity with the
# release app or another home (`--release-id` keeps <app>'s: the checkout's own home, a
# developer's everyday instance, keeps its browser logins and window frames); and
# NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows false. Then it is signed again ad hoc, keeping the source's
# entitlements and hardened runtime, and registered with LaunchServices.
